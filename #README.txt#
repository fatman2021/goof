GOOF (game-oriented object forth)
 is a subroutine-threaded forth compiler for the motorola 68000,
designed for game development on the Sega Megadrive game console.

I'm still working on adding in basic forth primitives, but it
currently supports defining 68k code words, colon words, and compiler
macros (it's a completely static compiler, so these are written in
Common Lisp, not forth).

It inlines short words into their callees, and will support combining
of commonly used groups of words to lower interpretation overhead.
